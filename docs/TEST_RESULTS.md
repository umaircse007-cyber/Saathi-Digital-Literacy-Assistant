## 11 October 2026 — Samsung voice lifecycle follow-up

- **PASS:** Samsung `VoiceLifecycleTest` 1/1 in 8.193 seconds. The synthetic local session survived Home, returned through Saathi's launcher, ignored an obsolete Stop notification after replacement, and stopped explicitly.
- **PASS:** Samsung `SelectionFormTest` 2/2 in 0.085 seconds. Required selection fields can be guided structurally without copying selected values; CAPTCHA and OTP-like labels retain their boundaries.
- **PASS:** Samsung `PhysicalSpeechTest` 1/1 in 30.814 seconds in Gradle's connected Android JUnit report. English/Hindi/Hinglish TTS callbacks and a bounded on-device recognizer result completed. It saved no audio or transcript. The incomplete streamed runner output does not supersede the final JUnit XML result.
- **TEST FIX:** The lifecycle test now requires an interactive unlocked screen, returns through the launcher after Home, and only revokes microphone/notification permissions that it granted itself. The device already held both permissions, so that restoration branch was not exercised.

No production UI or voice logic changed. This does not certify voice quality, recognition accuracy, lock-screen behavior, OEM survival, TalkBack, or continuous natural conversation. Evidence: `test-evidence/2026-10-11-samsung-voice/`.

## 11 October 2026 — Samsung transition-driver fixes and regression closeout

Current continuation: `HANDOFF_2026-10-11_TRANSITIONS.md`. UI and production logic unchanged this phase; all prior work preserved. Found the October 10 pause-test failure's invalid input: x=1076.5 on a 720px display during animation. Test driver now waits for stable, display-contained exact control bounds. 15 rounds/45 private-message-CAPTCHA handoffs PASS. Samsung actual-service WebView: 20 cycles PASS; no model calls.

Combined suite: **16/17 PASS**, retaining a commerce test-driver stale-coordinate failure across screenshot capture. Re-grounded the same expected step/product before action; final affected commerce+pause group **5/5 PASS**. All 17 distinct selected cases now have passing evidence across runs; this is not one 17/17 final combined run. Original failures remain saved. Test builds pass; prior 168 production unit/lint evidence was not rerun since production is unchanged. See `test-evidence/2026-10-11-transitions/`.

No production pause/resume regression established by the missed off-screen tap. Historical WebView stale-marker cause remains separate/unresolved; its page did mutate. Broader form semantics, general researched browser workflow grounding, genuine-provider quality, voice/OEM/human acceptance, protected portal and shared cloud-state gates remain open. Deployment deferred. No new provider calls, real Zepto actions, purchases, release/signing, commit or push. Usage stop remains below10%; this entry is a phase checkpoint, not a claim the usage floor was reached.

## 10 October 2026 — Selection fields, latest Samsung continuation

Read `HANDOFF_2026-10-10_SELECTION_FIELDS.md` first; it supplements the full end-to-end handoff. Latest user usage floor is below **10%**, superseding older 15% entries. **Final stop: 8% five-hour remaining / 56% weekly; below the 10% floor. No further work in this run.** No resets, paid calls, commit/push, deployment or real transactions.

Implemented structural native/Chromium dropdown recognition, private-safe selection content handling (including descendants), explicit label relationships, decision handoff and finite form re-observation. Samsung WebView's actual role is `comboBoxSelect` on generic View. Main UI/theme unchanged. 168 Android unit tests, debug/test builds, release Kotlin and lint pass (0 errors/60 warnings). An intermediate 12-case Samsung suite plus four synthetic commerce cases passed. **The final combined rerun reproduced an intermittent pause-fixture transition failure; do not describe final device acceptance as all passing.** Final result: **15/16 Samsung cases pass**, with the pause transition still failing; all other selected cases pass. One service record remains after restoring device settings; see cleanup notes. Evidence: `test-evidence/2026-10-10-selection-fields/final-device-after-guard.txt`. Do not repeat successful form tests without a new change; diagnose the missed transition from preserved input/window evidence. All model-call allowances remain exhausted.

## 10 October 2026 — Physical voice and current WebView regression continuation

- **PASS:** Samsung physical speech-engine callbacks completed for English, Hindi and Hinglish. After the authorized microphone permission/lifecycle check, the on-device recognizer became ready and returned an outcome. Audio and transcripts were not saved. This verifies engine callbacks only; it does not certify spoken intelligibility, recognition accuracy or a natural continuous conversation.
- **PASS:** Samsung foreground voice lifecycle check. The voice service stayed in its waiting state after Home, an old notification Stop action could not end a replacement session, and explicit Stop removed the service state. No speech input/output quality was measured in that test.
- **PASS:** Current local Pixel emulator, real AccessibilityService and synthetic WebView fixture: 40 mutation/detour/return cycles passed. The old target cleared after the fixture changed its Support control. A 600-event local storm was coalesced to one measured screen analysis with zero model calls.
- **HARNESS FIX:** A freshly installed emulator could remain accessibility-enabled but marked crashed. The test now uses the existing test-only reconnect helper before requiring a bound service. The first run also used an Android-rejected `/sdcard` output path; the valid run used app-private test output. Production guidance behavior was not changed.
- **NOT CERTIFIED:** historical WebView root cause, arbitrary browser/site compatibility, hours-long endurance, human speech quality, recognition accuracy, OEM background survival, or paid-cloud event-storm behavior.

Evidence: `docs/test-evidence/2026-10-10-webview-current/README.md` and the Samsung summary in `docs/HANDOFF_2026-10-10_END_TO_END.md`.

## 10 October 2026 — Real Zepto product-to-cart verification

- **PASS:** Full local Android unit suite: 166 tests; debug and test APK builds succeeded.
- **PASS:** Samsung physical-device observation on an existing Zepto product-results screen. A specific public product received exact Add guidance; after one user-authorized reversible add, Saathi detected the added/quantity state and highlighted the unique Cart action. No model request was made; fresh snapshot timings were 353 ms and 246 ms.
- **PASS:** The Cart opened to the same single test item. It was removed immediately, returning to the results screen where Saathi again guided the marked Add control. No checkout, payment, purchase, private entry or portal declaration occurred.
- **PASS:** `CommerceGuidanceTest` 4/4 on the Samsung after fixing its test-only overlay-window transition race. The retry preserves the originally grounded rectangle and never substitutes a nearby control.
- **NOT CERTIFIED:** arbitrary products, stock/location changes, checkout, payments, all Zepto versions, universal Android accessibility behavior, microphone/TTS/OEM background survival, or other browsers/apps.

Filtered, text-only evidence is recorded in `docs/test-evidence/2026-10-10-samsung/zepto-e2e-2026-10-10.md`; raw screenshots/XML containing device-specific address details were deleted. Production UI and core guidance behavior were not changed.

## 10 October 2026 — Samsung physical-device verification and real Zepto fixes

Usage stop: latest check4% short-window remaining/39% weekly. Stop new work now; threshold was crossed between checks. No reset/model calls/commit/push/deployment. Samsung SM-M076B Android16/API36 connected via wireless ADB (rediscover transport; do not reuse70 blindly). User approved uninstalling the incompatible-signature Saathi and replacing it; saved settings/drafts were deleted as explicitly authorized. Current debug build is installed; no release or deployment.

User explicitly authorized selecting an existing saved Zepto delivery location; Home selected. Zepto26.10.1 remains installed with its own data intact. No cart additions, order, payment, complaint or external message. Raw temporary screenshot/XML containing address details was removed from host/device; repository evidence contains filtered labels/structural metadata only.

PASS:165 Android unit tests plus debug/test builds. Physical controlled suite7/7 PASS after correcting Samsung instrumentation service reconnection (initial5/7 failed before scenarios because enabled service was recorded crashed after instrumentation restart). Service startup fix is test-harness-only, not proof of production crash recovery. Includes commerce3, native/WebView no-zoom forms2, pause/resume1 and permission-loss1. Seven passes precede the final initial-observation production fix; full post-fix device regression is PENDING.

Real Zepto found and fixed three general defects: explicit public weight ranges (450–500g) were falsely sensitive; rotating Search “suggestion” labels were not recognized; initial startLive on an already-open quiet screen did not explicitly request a snapshot. Reproduced first two in failing unit tests, third with real service trace (0 snapshots/no instruction) then fixed. Final real Zepto results: snapshot185ms, externalEvents0, GUIDING,0 private fields,0 redacted nodes, no failure; several milk products correctly produce user-choice guidance. Home search target also verified, with personal address redacted and local search guidance retained. This is PARTIAL real Zepto acceptance: specific product/Add/cart/checkout still NOT RUN. Earlier observer-only PASS with blank instruction was not a guidance pass; later probes assert guidance and preserve diagnostics.

Evidence: `docs/test-evidence/2026-10-10-samsung/`. `zepto-defects-before.txt`, `start-observation-build.txt`, `rebind-tests.txt`, `zepto-search-fixed.json`, `zepto-milk-diagnostics.json`, `zepto-milk-start-fixed.json`, `controlled-device.tar`. No screenshots of real address committed. UI production layout/theme unchanged.

NEXT FIRST: build latest test source (new quiet-start CommerceGuidanceTest wrapper added AFTER last APK build, not yet run); rerun affected physical commerce/forms/pause/revocation tests. Then continue actual Zepto with a specific observed product request, verify its own Add and cart state; any reversible test cart additions must be removed, never purchase. PhysicalSpeechTest source compiled earlier but NOT RUN; no microphone permission granted or real speech tested. Other broad gates remain unchanged. No background instrumentation/server remains. Installed app is current production code; ignored mentor APK predates these Samsung fixes and must be refreshed after regressions. Preserve all preexisting changes.

## 10 October 2026 — General commerce, element privacy and no-zoom form verification

Latest brief saved at `docs/specs/CROSS_APP_COMMERCE_REQUEST.txt`. Read `docs/CROSS_APP_COMMERCE.md` and `docs/test-evidence/2026-10-10-commerce/README.md` first. Existing work preserved; UI design unchanged; no model calls, release signing, commit, push or deployment.

Implemented: numeric resource-ID privacy false-positive fix; expanded/localized credential and price corpus; explicit node privacy categories; snapshot-local hierarchy; local search/product/Add/quantity/cart-review guidance; safe named promotional dismissal on recognized dialog containers; deduplicated badges for actual private editable fields; safe local form/product guidance alongside unfocused private fields with cloud/listening still suspended. No editable value getter or private upload. No automatic transaction/typing/clicking or completion assertion.

Verification:163 Android unit PASS; debug/test builds, release Kotlin and lint PASS (0 errors/61 warnings). Final selected emulator group18/19 passed; Chrome failed because its required local fixture server/reverse mapping were absent, then passed1/1 with those prerequisites restored.19 distinct selected cases therefore have passing final-code evidence across runs. Native/WebView forms advance without zoom and include mixed private-field guidance. Synthetic commerce follows the correct repeated Add to cart review and resumes the same goal after private entry. Backend unchanged; previous170/9 offline evidence retained, not rerun. Three of five UI captures pixel-identical; two light captures visually inspected with differences documented. Debug mentor APKs refreshed and exact configured-key scan passed.

NOT COMPLETE: real Zepto acceptance blocked by no installed Zepto/connected phone (question pending). Generic fixture is not Zepto. Richer screen semantics, flexible/free-form commerce and cab/ticket flows, general form validation/dependencies/completion, historical stale-marker attribution, broader genuine AI planning and shared durable storage remain repository-level work. Prior live provider allowance exhausted. Physical speech/OEM/TalkBack/performance and authenticated portal require actual hardware/access. TinyFish documentation fetched, not integrated: no comparative improvement benchmark yet. Deployment remains deferred.

Next: obtain legitimate Zepto test access and inspect its actual accessibility hierarchy, then close unsupported general control/intent cases without retailer rules. Preserve this turn's regressions and privacy boundaries. Do not repeat the missing Chrome fixture setup mistake. No active instrumentation or backend server remains; emulator cleanup recorded below.

## 10 October 2026 — Source-scoped prerequisites, usage handoff

Latest instruction: continue remaining work and hand off near/below10% short-window remaining (supersedes8% floor for this run). Latest check12%; final check follows. No resets, emulator, model calls, deployment, signing, commit or push in this phase. Existing Android/UI changes and mentor APK preserved.

Implemented a general backend fix: prerequisite label identities now include evidence ID; identical names from unrelated sources cannot satisfy each other's ordering requirements. Duplicate same-source candidates are withheld rather than silently overwriting each other. Reproduced cross-source acceptance before fixing it. The second new test initially had an invalid quotation lacking the selecting instruction; that fixture was corrected, not the safety validator.

PASS:38 focused backend checks,9 evaluation checks,170 full offline backend regressions. Evidence `test-evidence/2026-10-10-source-relations/` preserves initial failures and final results. No genuine model retest; all earlier call allowances remain exhausted. Passing these guards does not certify model reasoning accuracy. Android code/UI unchanged this phase, so emulator/build checks were not repeated. Prior debug APK remains current for Android; backend source includes this additional fix.

Added CLOUD_DURABLE_STATE_DESIGN.md: concrete proposed invariants for shared account authority, atomic quota reservations, idempotency, cancellation, leases/fencing and source-plan isolation. Explicitly DESIGN ONLY; external-store adapter and multi-instance/runtime tests remain unfinished. No production readiness claim.

Next priorities: broaden safe general form validation/dependencies/completion without reading secrets; genuine planning quality retest only with fresh scoped authorization; remaining browser/renderer/long-session regressions; implement shared persistence only for the chosen hosting architecture and validate container runtime. Physical phone audio/OEM/performance and authenticated portal require actual hardware/access. Current privacy handoff preserves tasks and structure-only markers; masking-off/private-value upload is absent. Deployment stays deferred. All current tests/processes finished; no cleanup needed. Resume from this working tree, not historical active-session IDs below.

## 10 October 2026 — Dynamic web forms and private-task continuity

User requested production-wide compatibility and uninterrupted help around private fields. Keep the task alive, but do not equate the private badge with consent to upload secrets. No masking-off/automatic private-value upload was added. See PRIVATE_FIELD_CONTINUITY.md for the explicit boundary.

Fixed initial/retargeted requests on already-open forms not arming the finite local follow-up window. Expanded actual-service WebView tests to delayed JavaScript conditional insertion/removal, ARIA invalidity/correction and the same form task entering/exiting an OTP-like field. Private marker, preserved session, safe return, no copied secret and zero gateway calls verified. No zoom gesture/manual refresh used. This does not establish every website's compatibility or the historical intermittent cache failure's sole cause.

Evidence `test-evidence/2026-10-10-dynamic-web`: 10 targeted unit tests plus debug/test builds pass; combined native/WebView/pause suite3 PASS; extended private-web case1 PASS. UI/style unchanged. Updated local mentor debug APK; hash and exact configured-key scan saved in artifact.json. Earlier mentor artifact hash belongs to preceding build. No live model calls, deployment, signing, commit or push. Emulator stopped after evidence export. Full production gates remain open: AI planning consistency, broad semantic form validation/completion, complete regressions, physical speech/OEM, legitimate protected portal, container/shared-state/hosting acceptance. Prior provider-call authorization remains exhausted.

## 10 October 2026 — Mentor demo preparation, targeted verification

Latest user requested fewer tests and a usable mentor demonstration. Prepared `deliverables/mentor-demo/Saathi-Mentor-Demo-debug.apk` and separate synthetic fixture APK (ignored build artifacts), `tools/mentor_demo.py` launcher and updated `DEMO_SCRIPT.md`. No deployment, release signing, commit, push or live model calls. All earlier work preserved.

Additional production fixes: explicit “not required” labels remain optional in English/Hindi/Hinglish; conflicting metadata remains unknown; invalid required fields precede invalid optional fields. Bounded local form probes now retain the presentation on identical safe snapshots, avoiding fallback-induced marker clearing/speech interruption. External events still invalidate immediately; probes cannot cross revisions, windows, sessions or privacy handoffs. Actual speech quality remains unverified.

Verification: 23 targeted unit tests pass; eight mentor route checks passed before the final probe refinement; six affected form/pause/privacy emulator checks pass on the final APK. Two extra form runs captured rendered markers. No broad unchanged suite repeated. Existing backend168/evaluation9 evidence from the preceding phase applies; backend unchanged this run. Five home/assistant/paused screenshots are pixel-identical to the saved baseline; production design files unchanged. Launcher shortcuts verified (initial private MainActivity route corrected to public LaunchActivity). Exact configured provider keys absent from both final APKs; hashes recorded. Evidence: `test-evidence/2026-10-10-mentor-demo/`.

Use the documented LOCAL mentor route. The separate fixture demonstrates actual accessibility guidance over synthetic external content; it is not genuine AI or real portal acceptance. No new provider-call allowance remains. Planning quality, broader semantic form validation/dependencies/completion, historical stale WebView causality, remaining comprehensive regressions, physical voice/OEM/portal and container/Cloud Run durable storage are still open. Do not call the full project finished or production-ready. UI screenshot comparison for the five selected app states is complete. Emulator test processes stopped after evidence collection; no backend server was started.

## Final collected results — 10 October 2026

155 Android unit, 168 backend, 9 evaluation and 7 focused emulator tests PASS. Focused tests include both reactive forms, three privacy cases, retained-task pause/resume and controlled portal handoffs. Build/release Kotlin/lint pass (61 warnings). Both previously active runs finished successfully; device diagnostics exported to `test-evidence/2026-10-10-reactive-forms/device-evidence.tar`. No active instrumentation/server. Emulator stopped after collection. Full post-change emulator suite and screenshot comparison remain pending. Four-call allowance exhausted; planning quality remains FAIL. Usage9% remaining at final save; stopping before starting another phase to respect8% floor.

## 10 October 2026 — Reactive form implementation (not final acceptance)

Baseline 82b9224. No commit/push/deploy/sign. Current UI styles/layout/navigation/logo unchanged; functional form guidance text updated.

Implemented finite local form observation fallback (eight 750ms checks per relevant external event, stops when ineligible), focus/selection subscriptions, fresh-snapshot required/optional/conditional/unknown policy, invalid-field prioritization, optional skipping, clearing/rebuilding and cursor-metadata-only presence. No editable value getter, automatic input/submission, inferred validity or completion. Private-context minimization now also clears new form metadata. Required label trailing-space parsing fixed.

Evidence: `test-evidence/2026-10-10-reactive-forms/`. 155 Android unit tests PASS, debug/test builds, release Kotlin compilation and lint PASS (0 errors/61 warnings). New native/WebView service tests now pass within the active focused run, after fixing separate fixture APK Kotlin-runtime and uppercase-button driver failures. These are fixture defects, not app crashes. `focused-final.txt` is still running pause/resume and portal tests: exec59588, emulator-5554. Inspect final result before another install/instrumentation run. Export app files/reactive-final plus earlier reactive-forms-debug and reactive-forms-final diagnostics. Build final APK includes all production Android changes.

All FOUR newly authorized provider calls CONSUMED. `live-reasoning-four/results.json`: English planning FAIL/disagreement (Gemini met sequence, Groq failed independent sequence expectations); Hindi incident PASS both. Gemini plan2670ms/incident1097ms; Groq2252ms/641ms. Not accuracy certification. No further calls authorized. A deterministic omission regression then found that missing navigation annotations bypass explicit quoted-order checks; general validator/prompt fix added, no genuine retest. Backend full rerun exec92762 (`backend-final-permitted.txt`, then evaluation-final.txt) pending at save; initial sandbox run failed localhost permissions, preserved separately. No raw model bodies retained.

Next: collect those runs; run remaining complete emulator groups with existing runner and new output; finish screenshot comparison and Cloud Run durable-store documentation/runtime checks. Docker absent. Prior cache-focused 3 tests and remaining practice7/research18/connection3/visual15/browser2 runs from 9 October are complete and passing, but predate today's production changes. Historical stale WebView marker root cause is still a cache hypothesis, not established by passing reruns.

Form capability remains PARTIAL: presence is not validity; VALID/VALIDATION_PENDING have no positive evidence producer; unknown caret-zero fields stay uncertain; conditional membership is refreshed rather than arbitrary dependency inference; identities are scoped to current observation; no automatic form readiness/submission/completion claim. Generic trusted validation/dependency/completion architecture and broader dynamic/keyboard/renderer/E2E coverage remain repository work. Do not claim the 13-phase mandate complete. Preserve privacy/freshness/pause boundaries. Real phone/voice/OEM and authenticated portal require external acceptance. Cloud Run shared persistence remains unfinished; deployment deferred.

Stop at the user's 8% short-window floor; latest pre-handoff check12% remaining. Emulator started this run (exec81601); no live provider server remains. Preserve all evidence and ignored credentials.

## 9 October 2026 — Acceptance closeout, usage-floor handoff

**NOT COMPLETE / NOT READY.** Latest short-window usage is 7% remaining (weekly 70%); the user's 8% floor was crossed between checks. No resets, new live model calls, deployment, signing, commit or push. Stop new work and inspect active results on the next authorized continuation. Preserve all current changes on baseline `7012254`.

Completed: provider slow-header/cancellation defects reproduced and fixed with absolute-deadline TLS interruption and joined per-call watchers. 168 backend tests, 9 evaluation tests, 51/51 probes, 147 Android unit tests (explicit uncached rerun), six local hosted checks, five repetitions of 11 TLS/diagnostic tests, 2,000 recovery plus 2,000 pre-cancelled requests pass. Emulator TalkBack coexistence passed (not audible/human usability). The earlier two-hour run finished: 111 rounds, 7,209,179 ms, 1,554 local requests, 111 cancellations, zero model calls; file descriptors/threads bounded, PSS/heap increased modestly, no heap-leak certification. See `test-evidence/2026-10-09-acceptance-closeout/README.md` and JSON evidence.

**New active failure:** full core rerun reproduced stale guidance after a genuine WebView DOM change. `core-failure-device/mandate-core-final/transition-failure.png` visibly shows **Support opened** while Saathi still marks **Support**. `transition-input.txt`, windows, event and tap traces preserved. A separate portal fixture stopped at SENSITIVE_HANDOVER instead of CAPTCHA. Do not label either fixed by earlier passes. Settings test also failed; its corrected driver waits for the actual unique control and rechecks tap geometry. Its focused two-test retest passes and the next combined run passes Settings; this is a harness improvement, not proof of historical WebView causality.

**Unverified production candidate:** `SaathiAccessibilityService.scheduleCopy()` calls `clearCache()` on API33+ before reading the current root to avoid cached WebView descendants. Build/unit/release compilation/lint pass (`cache-build.txt`). This is a cache-staleness hypothesis pending functional verification, not an established root cause. Android <33 remains unchanged. Do not weaken privacy, old-window filtering or freshness to force acceptance.

Active tests at stop:
- emulator-5556, exec session **74450**: `cache-focused.txt`; LiveAccessibilityIntegrationTest with **40 WebView cycles**, PortalWorkflowIntegrationTest and PauseResumeIntegrationTest with **10 handoff rounds**. Output `/data/user/0/com.saathi/files/closeout-cache`. Last observed still running first test. Read final result and export evidence before any new install/test on this device.
- emulator-5554, exec session **54796**: `remaining-progress.txt`, runner `run_remaining.py`; practice **7 PASS**, research/reporting, connection, visual and browser groups pending/running. Output app files `mandate-<group>-final`; local fixture servers/reverse mapping are owned and cleaned by this runner. No genuine providers. Do not install/run another test there until finished.
- Original two-hour run is DONE; its data was exported before installing this final candidate on 5554. Original evidence belongs to the earlier APK, not this cache candidate.

UI: no design/layout/style/logo changes. Initial comparison 12/14 pairs identical; paused screenshot mismatch was Light vs Dark persisted preference, now the test explicitly selects/restores Dark; Home difference is inspected pressed shading. Final same-theme capture comparison is pending. `ui-source-preservation.json` was captured before the cache candidate; only new production Android edit since it is accessibility cache invalidation, not UI. Do not cite that earlier JSON as proving zero current production edits.

Next required work:
1. Inspect those two final test outputs. If WebView/portal still fail, collect traces and diagnose; do not keep a speculative fix just because it compiles. If passing, add deterministic cache/fresh-observation coverage and repeat affected combined core/service/privacy/cost checks; a passing rerun alone is not root-cause evidence.
2. Export final screenshots and perform same-theme paused comparison. Consolidate counts only after all final groups finish. Earlier core runs failed (one Settings failure, then WebView and portal failures); they must not be counted as 29 passing.
3. Update report/matrix with actual final evidence. Complete code/doc diff and secret checks after any new changes. Current code/doc diff check passed; raw completed log files retain normal trailing blank lines.
4. Genuine planning/incident retest awaits a fresh scoped answer. An asynchronous request for **up to four calls** was issued, but no answer was received before stopping. Previous eight-call allowance is exhausted. `evaluation.final_acceptance --suite reasoning` now enforces four reservations and has passing fixture tests; DO NOT execute absent explicit authorization.
5. Physical voice/OEM, legitimate protected portal, browser full HTTPS metadata limitations and Docker/runtime acceptance remain unverified. Single-host SQLite pilot is not stateless Cloud Run support; shared durable state/ownership architecture remains necessary for that target. No deployment.

## Usage-floor stop — final state

Further work stopped after the usage check returned 5% weekly remaining. No daily window was available. See NEXT_CONTINUATION.md for active test processes, completed groups, unresolved Chrome diagnostics and pending screenshot/endurance verification. This is NOT a completed pre-deployment certification.

## 9 October 2026 — Final mandate continuation (verification in progress)

Latest engineering/evidence report: [PREDEPLOYMENT_VALIDATION.md](PREDEPLOYMENT_VALIDATION.md). This section supersedes older counts and next-step lists below; historical records are retained.

Implemented: bounded primary attempt/fallback within the original screen deadline; Groq-first navigation default (explicit config preserved); private-safe phased HTTPS diagnostics; narrative private handoff; explicit prerequisite/denial guards; accurate capability copy using unchanged styles; controlled portal/copy/paste/rotation/lock tests; allowlisted non-root pilot container template.

Verified: 147 Android unit tests, 165 backend tests, 9 evaluation tests, 51/51 probes, 2,000 recovery plus 2,000 pre-cancelled synthetic requests, six local Gunicorn checks, zero lint errors/61 warnings, debug/test builds and release compilation. No configured-key matches in source/non-ignored files or decompressed APKs. Current emulator reruns and two-hour target must be read from `test-evidence/2026-10-09-final-mandate/`; do not call ongoing runs complete.

New eight-call allowance EXHAUSTED: English/Hinglish paired navigation passed; Gemini planning/incident timed out waiting for headers, and Groq failed independent plan/signal expectations. Post-run reasoning guard/prompt changes are offline-tested only. No more live calls without new scoped authorization. Physical audio/OEM, legitimate protected portal, browser-dependent full HTTPS origin, historical post-tap causality and deployment acceptance remain unresolved; do not declare production readiness.

## Final verification addendum — 9 October 2026

UI preserved; deployment/release not executed. This addendum supersedes earlier test counts in this file. The latest production fix makes the local private/CAPTCHA handoff precede practice-ID eligibility, while retaining the package boundary, no-target behavior for minimized screens and no private backend calls. Request cancellation at Pause and gateway cleanup-before-callback remain verified.

Final application checks: **147 Android unit tests, 152 offline backend tests, 7 evaluation tests and 51/51 offline probes pass.** Emulator groups after the last production edit: **27 core/research/incident, 4 practice transport/handoff, and 21 connection/reporting/recovery/startup tests pass (52 total across these groups).** The last combined 21-test run passes after correcting obsolete private-form expectations and bounded transition/task-return test helpers; all earlier failures are retained. Eight UI checks passed, with the source and screenshot comparison described in the evidence index. Debug/test builds, release Kotlin compilation and lint pass; lint retains 61 warnings and zero errors.

Evidence: [current index](test-evidence/2026-10-09-research-ordering/README.md), [reproduction](test-evidence/2026-10-09-research-ordering/REPRODUCE.md), [UI comparison](test-evidence/2026-10-09-research-ordering/UI_COMPARISON.md). The four authorized genuine calls are consumed: English paired PASS; Hinglish Groq accepted and Gemini timed out. Genuine semantic accuracy/latency remains PARTIAL. No further live calls were made. Local fixture servers, reverse mappings and temporary fixture credentials were removed; ignored provider configuration was left untouched.

**Open gates, not claimed complete:** historical WebView/cloud failure attribution; broader semantic privacy and hours-long resource acceptance; trustworthy full browser metadata when the browser does not expose it; broader genuine-provider accuracy/latency; physical-device voice/OEM/TalkBack/performance; legitimate protected portal steps. Some need new evidence/reproduction, others require unavailable hardware/access or a new scoped model-call allowance. The eight-round mixed-fault run is 140 seconds, not hours-long certification. The first mixed failure remains unproven despite separately fixing a demonstrated capacity-ordering race. Hosting, release connectivity and production operational validation stay deferred by the user. Do not describe Saathi as bug-free or fully production-ready.

## 9 October 2026 — Current verification

Research, incident assessment and API checks cancel on Pause; the gateway releases request capacity before callbacks. Both defects have failing-before/passing-after evidence. The current UI is preserved. Four newly authorized genuine calls are exhausted: English paired navigation PASS, Hinglish pair FAIL due to Gemini timeout; no broad accuracy claim.

147 Android unit / 152 backend / 7 evaluation tests and 51 offline probes pass. Final core suite 25/25; transport/cancellation 8/8 with 1000 requests; reporting 14/14; mixed retest eight rounds in 140 seconds; UI 8/8 with 12/14 identical PNGs (two pressed-state shading differences). See [current handoff](NEXT_CONTINUATION.md), [evidence and retained failures](test-evidence/2026-10-09-research-ordering/README.md) and [UI comparison](test-evidence/2026-10-09-research-ordering/UI_COMPARISON.md).

Deployment/release remain deferred. Physical-device/protected-portal acceptance, broader model quality/latency, browser full-address limitations and historical/intermittent failure attribution remain open. Older entries below are historical, not current blockers already resolved above.

## 9 October 2026 — Complete-tree privacy and resource cleanup

Implemented fail-closed complete accessibility traversal: node/depth limits, missing children and cancelled/expired copies cannot produce a partial safe screen. Child references are released on every unwind; accepted service work runs cleanup after destruction. Capture timestamps precede copying and stale delivery is rejected. No UI layout/theme changes, live provider calls, commits or deployment.

Verified so far: 147 Android unit tests, 152 backend tests, six evaluation tests and 51/51 offline probes pass. Debug/test builds, release Kotlin and lint pass (0 errors/61 warnings). Pattern scan found no matching secrets in tracked/nonignored text. New real-service oversized-tree regression passes with actual rejection evidence and original-task recovery. Ten thousand mixed traversal tests balance child ownership; this is not proof of Android heap leak freedom.

The first combined emulator run was 16 tests / 2 failures. One was a polling helper treating an incomplete transitional WebView tree as an exception; helpers now retry only missing-branch observations under the existing timeout. The other is OPEN: ResearchRecoveryUiTest.leavingDuringPlanRequestDiscardsLateFailureAndDoesNotRestoreRetry showed late error copy after returning. Inspect whether the fixture's five-second release/Compose idle waiting completes before Home/onStop; do not assume that hypothesis is the cause or weaken cancellation assertions. Production ResearchActivity was not changed.

Final affected browser/service rerun is in test-evidence/2026-10-09-observation-reliability/emulator-final.txt. See that directory's REPRODUCE.md for baseline failures, fixture-runtime diagnosis and commands. Initial separate test-APK crash was missing Kotlin Intrinsics in a new provider; Java fixture fixed it. This is unrelated to the historical WebView failure.

NEXT FIRST: collect final rerun if still running, then diagnose the research cancellation regression with request-release and activity-stop ordering. Keep accepted pause/resume/privacy tests. Historical WebView/cloud intermittence, broader hours-long/resource checks, genuine provider prompt retest, browser full-HTTPS metadata limitations, physical voice/OEM and authenticated portal steps remain open. No claim of production readiness or zero bugs. Stop above the user's 8% five-hour floor; deployment/release remain deferred.

## 9 October 2026 — Handoff verification completed; broader remediation remains open

Collected the previously unfinished run: 120 WebView cycles passed in 198 seconds, 60 private/message/CAPTCHA handoffs passed. Fixed Chrome's outdated privacy-copy assertion. Added debug-only gateway reason counts with an allowlist test; release diagnostics are no-op, no bodies/credentials saved. The earlier synthetic-cloud failure did not reproduce in the focused or combined rerun: cause remains unresolved, not claimed fixed.

Final evidence: **140 Android unit, 152 backend, six evaluation, 17 combined emulator and 10 reporting/consent tests pass**. Debug/test builds, release Kotlin compilation and lint (0 errors/61 warnings) pass. 660 synthetic events produced four local-backend requests, two cancellations, zero genuine provider calls. The earlier 51/51 offline probes remain passing; no architecture changes there. Eight UI methods passed before/after; 11/14 PNG pairs pixel-identical, remaining differences inspected as privacy-copy/scroll and pressed-state tint. No design changes. See test-evidence/2026-10-09-private-handoff/UI_COMPARISON.md and continuation-* logs. Fixture servers, mappings and temporary token cleaned up. No commit/deploy/live model calls/reset credits.

Stop reason: weekly usage reached 2% remaining despite 50% five-hour remaining; preserve this verified phase. Still OPEN: historical WebView failure cause, earlier intermittent cloud-fixture cause, broader mixed-fault/hours-long and retained-resource testing, full real-HTTPS destination binding where Chrome omits metadata, genuine provider prompt/accuracy retest (new authorization required), physical voice/OEM/TalkBack and authenticated cybercrime portal steps. Current checks do not prove absence of all leaks, universal compatibility or production readiness. Deployment remains deferred.

Next: use existing sanitized diagnostics to reproduce unresolved failures; complete remaining privacy/resource coverage without repeating accepted pause/resume. Real provider retest requires a new bounded allowance; previous four calls were consumed. No hardware or legitimate protected portal session is available.

## 9 October 2026 — Private handoff fixes; usage-floor handoff

See FINAL_RELIABILITY_REPORT.md for the 15-area audit, fixes, evidence and open gates. 139 Android unit, 152 backend, six evaluation tests and 51/51 offline probes pass; build/release compilation/lint pass. New masking regression reproduced before fixing. 60 handoffs pass with zero cloud calls. Current UI preserved; functional privacy copy updated. Final stress/browser run and after-screenshot captures were still executing at the 9% usage check: inspect their logs, collect images and compare pixels before declaring this phase complete. Physical-device, genuine provider retest, authenticated portal and real HTTPS positive binding remain open. No commit/deploy/live calls. Prior pause/resume remains accepted. Exact brief saved in specs/FINAL_RELIABILITY_PRIVACY_HANDOFF_REQUEST.txt.

## 8 October 2026 — Source-cited control guidance and bounded live evaluation

The user asked to finish remaining pre-deployment work; **deployment/release remain deferred and overall remediation remains open**. Preserve this run and the earlier uncommitted recovery/expiry changes. The 8% short-window stop floor still applies. No reset credits, publishing, commits or pushes were used.

### Implemented and verified

- Optional `NavigationHint` on a researched step: a READ_OPTION or blank public FIELD_LABEL with an exact label in an explicit source quotation. Both plan providers must agree on the hint as well as the dependency graph. Extra actions/URLs, absent citations, sensitive/consequential labels and Unicode disguises fail closed. Existing plans without hints remain readable.
- Existing Research UI offers a separate **Guide this step** consent dialog, using the same green/glass/content-sized controls. Local matching requires the current reviewed prerequisite, fresh evidence/observation, an exact full HTTPS browser address, and one enabled matching control. Filled fields, private/CAPTCHA/payment/consent/error/security-warning screens and high-risk contexts retain handover. It never clicks, types, pastes or infers completion. Step confirmation remains explicit in Saathi.
- New live-navigation-only provider prompt removes synthetic-practice completion instructions and explicitly requires empty completion evidence. The validator still rejects unsupported evidence. Offline tests verify both provider payloads and unchanged rejection; the revised prompt has NOT had another genuine call.
- Source/pause emulator regression on the previously accepted expiry fix passed. A lifecycle test's forced ActivityScenario return failed in a combined run; the test now uses actual Home/explicit return and passes. This is a harness fix, not a claimed production lifecycle defect.

### Evidence and limits

`test-evidence/2026-10-08-plan-guidance/`: 132 Android unit tests, 152 backend tests, 6 evaluation tests (4 harness, multilingual architecture, four-call probe harness), 51/51 offline probes; debug/test builds and lint 0 errors/61 warnings. Nine final emulator tests pass, including research consent, recovery, source/pause and voice lifecycle. A separate seven-test local cloud/transport/privacy/permission suite also passes. The public HTTPS test's PASS means observation completed, not that site provenance was established.

A real-service WebView run completed **40 mutation/detour/return cycles in about 40 seconds** with stale-marker clearing and preserved session. PSS sampled about 118–122 MB; this short sample proves neither a leak nor long-term stability. The original historical post-tap failure did not reproduce and its cause remains unknown. One unrelated lifecycle-harness failure in the combined run is retained in `ui-endurance.txt`.

The newly authorized **4 genuine provider calls are fully consumed**. Both Gemini and Groq returned HTTP 200 for both fictional cases. The cited-plan case passed paired validation with the Requirements hint. Basic navigation failed paired acceptance because Gemini returned unsupported completion evidence (`COMPLETION_UNPROVEN`); Groq passed. Safe diagnostics include timings/tokens; no raw model replies or keys. Do not reuse this authorization or delete the exclusive run marker. Genuine overall accuracy and prompt-fix efficacy are not certified by one passing plan.

Public Chrome inspection observed the cybercrime portal entry page without a security warning. Chrome exposed scheme-less editable address metadata, so exact full-HTTPS binding correctly stayed unavailable. The example.org content was not established by this run. No certificate bypass, declaration acceptance, private entry, authenticated-form walkthrough or complaint submission took place.

### Remaining work, not hidden by deployment deferral

1. Reliable full-destination evidence in supported real browsers; the new binding currently provides safe fallbacks when Chrome omits its scheme. Positive source-bound highlights have controlled policy/contract tests, not real-HTTPS service-to-overlay certification. High-risk/private flows are still manual.
2. Broader live semantic planning/incident accuracy and a separately authorized retest of the corrected live prompt. Never call test fixtures genuine AI or assume all provider failures share this cause.
3. Reproduce/diagnose the historical WebView post-tap failure with current input/window traces; broaden mixed-fault, hours-long resource and semantic privacy coverage. A short passing repetition does not close this gate.
4. Physical microphone/TTS, OEM background survival, TalkBack/performance and actual protected portal/form acceptance. No physical phone was available; emulator results do not certify them.
5. Deployment, production host/TLS/accounts and release execution remain deferred by user request. Do not claim the project is fully production-ready.

## 8 October 2026 — Expired-plan revival fixed; 8% usage-floor handoff

Latest user priority covers actionable browser planning, HTTPS/WebView reliability, genuine provider quality, stress/privacy, device validation and protected cybercrime guidance. Deployment/release remain deferred. This run began with only 20% short-window usage remaining; at 10% new work stopped to preserve a handoff above the requested 8% floor. No resets or live provider calls were used; all earlier uncommitted changes are preserved.

Reproduced and fixed an additional lifecycle defect: a plan already observed as expired could become current again after the wall clock moved backward. Android EvidencePlan now latches observed expiry and clears review; backend TaskPlan similarly latches stale evidence across review, eligibility and completion checks. Fresh research is required. No UI changes or weakened privacy/pause/action boundaries. Android regression repeats 10,000 review/progression attempts; backend repeats 100. These are deterministic state tests, not physical-device endurance measurements.

Evidence: `test-evidence/2026-10-08-plan-expiry/`. Both failing baseline tests are saved. Final 128 Android unit tests, 148 backend tests and 5 evaluation tests pass; debug build passes. Existing pause/resume unit coverage remains passing. Emulator integration was NOT rerun after this small expiry change; the preceding 10-test emulator result belongs to the prior phase.

Next: run the focused source/pause emulator regression on the expiry change, then continue verified actionable plan/browser binding and full HTTPS address acceptance. The saved historical WebView failure directory contains a passing rerun and tap geometry, not enough input/window evidence to prove the original cause; do not call it resolved. Broader mixed-fault/semantic privacy and long-session integration remain open. Genuine provider evaluation has not been rerun: establish deterministic architecture readiness and a new explicit bounded call budget before calls. No phone was connected/validated in this run; physical voice/OEM/performance and protected portal steps remain manual/unverified. All six requested workstreams remain partially open, not completed by this expiry fix.

## 8 October 2026 — Research cancellation and explicit retry recovery

Continued from clean `b7f18be`. Deployment and release are deferred by the user. This phase changes research/backend recovery only; existing Saathi colors, glass controls, navigation and privacy/action boundaries remain intact.

**Fixed with reproduced failures:** cancelled completed evidence bundles survived their short cancellation tombstone; reading a saved bundle blocked behind unrelated retrieval; unexpected retrieval exceptions escaped the research recovery contract; an explicit second plan request reused the first attempt's session and was rejected as stale. Cancellation now deletes the bundle under the publication lock, metadata reads use a separate short lock, retrieval errors return fixed safe categories, and each explicit attempt has a bounded identity hashed from its complete request ID. Replays, consent, freshness, principal isolation and provider budgets remain enforced.

**App recovery:** planning failures retain source excerpts for manual reading. Only temporary failures expose the existing consent button for another explicit request. There is no automatic retry. Expiry/cancellation require new research; configuration, quota, certificate and evidence failures have fixed English/Hindi/Hinglish instructions. Editing the task clears old sources. Leaving the activity cancels work and suppresses late responses.

**Validation:** 147 offline backend tests; 127 Android unit tests; 51/51 offline capability probes; 4 evaluation-harness tests plus 1 multilingual architecture acceptance test; debug/test builds and lint (0 errors, 61 existing warnings). All 10 final focused emulator tests passed, including cancellation while away, explicit retry, source reading and pause/resume. Evidence is in `test-evidence/2026-10-08-research-recovery/`. No live provider calls or deployment/release validation occurred. A separate pre-existing incident test timestamp race was fixed in fixtures without weakening production freshness rules.

**Next:** actionable reviewed-plan-to-browser binding and real HTTPS full-address acceptance remain repository work; source reading is not arbitrary task navigation. Continue mixed-fault/long-session and semantic privacy acceptance and investigate the historical intermittent WebView transition. Real provider accuracy/failure evaluation requires separate authorization; real protected workflows and physical speech/OEM/TalkBack/performance remain manual. Deployment, hosting and release are explicitly scheduled for a later phase. Overall remediation remains open.

## 8 October 2026 — Source companion validation and browser/privacy fixes

Started from clean commit `d91b216`. Current run uses the user's **15% remaining five-hour usage stop rule**; no resets used. At handoff preparation 24% remained; final check after verification showed 13%, so work stopped. Preserve all current changes; no commit/push/deploy or live provider calls were made.

**Implemented and tested:** public hostname restrictions for source opening; bounded browser-chrome inspection that rejects truncated/ambiguous trees, edited addresses and WebView-spoofed address bars; certificate/malware-warning handover and backend control rejection; evidence retrieval-time bounds against clock rollback; source expiry on quiet pages; retained plan on temporarily blocked resume; explicit return-to-plan from bubble/assistant; discard stale plan on new research, edit or finish. Semantic message/document/account contexts now enter the shared private/listening handover even without numeric secrets.

**Evidence:** 125 Android unit tests, 140 backend tests, 5 evaluation-harness tests, 51/51 offline probes and the controlled multilingual research acceptance test pass. Debug/test builds and release Kotlin compilation pass; lint 0 errors/61 warnings. Three initial source/Chrome/pause-resume integration tests and a broader 10-test research/protocol/source/Chrome/voice-lifecycle/permission suite passed. The final **four private-message/source/Chrome/pause-resume/voice regression tests passed** on the final build (`test-evidence/2026-10-08-browser/privacy-final.txt`). Groups overlap. Earlier fixture failures (wrong label and destroyed ActivityScenario) remain saved and were fixed in the harness.

**Scope:** source-reading mode retains the original goal/current prerequisite and never sends cloud requests, chooses a target or marks completion. Real Chrome's local HTTP fixture correctly fails HTTPS provenance matching and preserves challenge handover. Positive exact-address matching and Brave traversal have controlled unit evidence, not real HTTPS browser/site authority certification. No real microphone speech, CAPTCHA solving, private entry or transactions were tested.

**Next repository priorities:** verified browser origin/source/step binding for actionable guidance remains open; do not bypass high-risk or stale-response guards. Add actual supported-browser full-address acceptance without assuming hidden HTTPS or bypassing certificates; keep unknown destinations blocked. Expand mixed-fault/long-session and semantic privacy acceptance. Original intermittent WebView post-tap cause is still unproven. The local source companion is progress, not closure of arbitrary workflow planning.

**External/manual gates:** selected reviewed search/source configuration and actual HTTPS hosting/user provisioning; separately authorized genuine provider failure/accuracy evaluation; real protected workflows; physical speech/OEM/TalkBack/performance. No new live-call authorization exists. Overall remediation and production readiness remain open.

## 7 October 2026 — Browser source companion in progress; usage-limited handoff

User changed this run's stop rule to **10% remaining in the short (five-hour) usage window**. Started at 33%; last check was 11%, so new implementation stopped to save this handoff. This supersedes the older 25% floor for this run only. Do not treat this phase or the full remediation as complete.

Implemented locally: `ReviewedPlanNavigation` keeps the original goal/current dependency, requires an exact full HTTPS source-document address, rejects obvious lookalikes/credentials/query/fragment/encoded paths, and invalidates on detour, expiry or changed review/step. `BrowserLocationReader` reads supported Chrome/Brave address-bar metadata outside WebViews; omitted schemes/focused address editing/unsupported browsers fail closed. Service/session wiring carries this separate local source-reading mode through explicit pause/resume, clears it on task replacement/Stop, and never dispatches cloud requests or infers a target/completion in this mode. Research UI adds an explicit source-opening consent dialog using existing controls, pauses on return and requires applicability review again. This is source reading, not verified arbitrary task navigation or proof of TLS/site safety.

Passing evidence: baseline absent-class compile failure, 5 new unit tests, then **116 total Android unit tests (0 failures/errors/skips)**, debug/test builds and release Kotlin compilation. `test-evidence/2026-10-07-plan-browser/android-first.txt` is passing. `git diff --check` passes. No backend edits, live calls, emulator runs, deploy, commit or push in this continuation.

**Not yet accepted:** new UI/service/browser integration has only compiled, not run on emulator. Earlier emulator evidence does not certify these new changes. Next run FIRST test the source companion through real service events and existing pause/resume/auth/CAPTCHA suite; test return-to-research, rotation, failed browser launch, permissions, task replacement and expiry. Add malicious WebView address-bar spoof/duplicate/truncated-tree tests for BrowserLocationReader, verify actual Chrome full-address availability, and ensure any retained source state is cleared appropriately after abandonment. Review URL canonicalization against the backend's public-destination policy (including IP/local hosts), depth-limit ambiguity and certificate error screens before enabling any positive browser guidance. Harden these if tests expose gaps; do not relax safeguards to obtain a match.

The companion never opens private forms automatically or highlights proposed plan actions. Binding a reviewed dependency to a verified live actionable target and explicit completion evidence remains unfinished repository work. High-risk ordinary guidance still fails closed. Full applicable regressions and capability-matrix review must follow runtime validation. No genuine provider authorization is renewed.

## 7 October 2026 — Research architecture and deterministic remediation (overall work open)

Implemented bounded consented retrieval/search, reviewed source authority/provenance and freshness, paired evidence-cited prerequisite/eligibility graphs, dependency checklists with explicit user-confirmed completion, and evidence-cited incident hypotheses. New research screens retain the existing green/glass theme, content-sized controls and secure memory-only handling. Added safe provider HTTP/validation diagnostics, deterministic Chrome fixtures, cloud-event/resource measurements, keyboard/private-context protection, payment/cookie handovers and English/Hindi/Hinglish review controls. No service-specific prerequisite lookup was introduced.

Final evidence: **139 backend tests, 111 Android unit tests, 5 evaluation-harness tests and 51/51 offline probes pass**. Passing emulator groups: 18 final focused tests, 22 extended UI/privacy/transport tests, 3 connection checks and 4 practice-gateway checks; groups overlap and are not added as unique tests. The accepted pause/resume/authentication/CAPTCHA behavior remains covered. Debug/test builds and release Kotlin compilation pass; lint has 0 errors/61 warnings. No live model calls, deployment, signing, commit or push occurred.

See [capability matrix](REMEDIATION_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md), [architecture](RESEARCH_AND_PLANNING.md) and [evidence index](test-evidence/2026-10-07-research/README.md). Controlled adapters and fictional sources are not genuine-model accuracy or completion of the 142 real-world workflows.

**Next repository work:** connect the reviewed plan/current dependency and source provenance to fresh live browser observations, preserving the original goal across detours/redirects and requiring explicit revalidation. The checklist currently remains separate from live guidance; high-risk destinations without proof stay blocked. Continue mixed-fault/endurance, semantic privacy and browser coverage. Do not weaken privacy, stale-response, authentication, CAPTCHA, consent or user-action boundaries to enable this integration.

**External/manual gates:** chosen/reviewed search and source registry, actual HTTPS deployment/account provisioning and standalone-phone acceptance; separately authorized genuine provider evaluation after deterministic gates; real protected workflows; physical speech/OEM/TalkBack/performance. Earlier provider failures and the historical intermittent WebView post-tap cause remain unresolved. A reproduced late-old-window event defect was fixed, but is not proven to explain the historical failure.

Weekly usage reached **16% remaining**, below the saved 25% continuation floor. This is a handoff, not remediation completion. Local fixture servers, reverse mappings, temporary test tokens and the emulator were stopped/removed; real ignored credentials were not changed. Resume from current working changes; do not rebuild the accepted pause/resume phase or repeat unchanged live calls.

## 7 October 2026 — Retained-task pause/resume and private challenge handover

Final verification: **95 Android unit tests and all 10 focused emulator tests pass**, debug/test builds and release Kotlin compile pass. The added immediate-start/pause UI test found a real `ForegroundServiceDidNotStartInTimeException`; fixed by acknowledging pending foreground starts before service shutdown (promotion alone was insufficient). No production guidance/audio services remained after the final tests; the separate fixture WebView service remained until emulator shutdown. Evidence: `test-evidence/2026-10-07-resumption/verification.json`, `final-regression.txt`, `paused-ui-acknowledged.txt` and screenshots.

Latest user priority: reliable resumption. Implemented memory-only paused task settings, explicit permission/unlock/service checks, fresh session identity/current-tree request, same-theme Resume/Discard controls and paused speech preference preservation. Private/password and CAPTCHA screens now intercept guidance before gateway dispatch, disable listening, preserve the original goal and re-observe to resume after a safe screen returns. Manual Pause never auto-resumes; Stop, permission-loss safety stops and process death do not revive tasks.

95 Android unit tests and debug/test/release Kotlin builds pass. Nine focused emulator regression tests pass, including three OTP-like/private and three CAPTCHA round trips plus three rapid manual cycles, missing-permission refusal with retained task, stale identity rejection and Stop cleanup. Additional paused-screen UI evidence is in `test-evidence/2026-10-07-resumption/paused-ui.txt`. See PAUSE_RESUME.md for limits and failed fixture attempts: separate test APK needed array iteration instead of unavailable Kotlin collections runtime. No live provider calls, deployment or push.

Broader implementation brief saved at specs/IMPLEMENTATION_REMEDIATION_REQUEST.txt; research/planning/eligibility/provider diagnostics/browser readiness remain unfinished. Actual speech/device/OEM and real-site auth/CAPTCHA acceptance remain unverified. Preserve all existing evaluation fixes and evidence.

## 7 October 2026 — Real-world capability evaluation

Created `SAATHI_REAL_WORLD_EVALUATION.md` and `evaluation/` with 142 structured scenarios (28 prerequisite, 37 eligibility), repeatable offline probes, manual scorecard gates and CI. Five reproduced boundary failures fixed: Unicode/spaced-secret privacy bypasses and backend duplicate-label ambiguity. UI/theme preserved; instrumentation fixture changes only.

Evidence: 51/51 offline probes after correction (initial 46/51), 95 backend + 91 Android unit + 4 harness tests pass; debug/test builds and release Kotlin compile pass. Seven distinct emulator tests pass; Chrome blocked by first-run onboarding in two attempts (first server setup also corrected). 600 emitted external fixture events yielded two service records/two analyses, local cloud-disabled scope. Native/WebView guidance passed; historical WebView failure cause still unknown.

User explicitly authorized at most 12 genuine provider calls: all 12 attempts used across six paired synthetic cases, ZERO accepted. Failure reasons: unavailable, two timeouts, two uncertain, provider_request. 4,566 reported tokens is incomplete billing evidence. No further live calls under this authorization. This probe used paired gateway validation, not ordinary primary/fallback Android E2E. Keys stayed private; exact debug APK scan found neither key.

Read the report before further work: arbitrary research, prerequisite/eligibility reasoning and source provenance are missing. 142 catalog workflows remain blocked, not passed. Next: safe per-provider validation diagnostics, separately authorized genuine retest, Chrome onboarding/browser acceptance, cloud event-storm/privacy audit, dependency/retrieval architecture, hosted/phone/voice acceptance. No deploy, signing or push occurred. Working changes remain on `fix/backend-response-time`; its prior baseline 935863a was already pushed.

## 7 October 2026 - Backend recovery on latest teammate code

**95 backend tests / 90 Android unit tests / 12 emulator test executions (11 distinct) pass**; debug/test builds pass; lint **0 errors / 61 warnings**. New regressions first reproduced failure streaks surviving success and task uncertainty incorrectly opening permanent circuits. Cooldown recovery, single-probe concurrency, failed-probe reopening, cancellation and quota enforcement now pass. Android verifies disconnected local server -> restart -> ten successful status calls -> server shutdown; old-endpoint cancellation; no networked practice from AI opt-in. Existing live primary/decoder and mock-practice tests pass, plus the full synthetic live flow over the emulator host route without adb reverse.

[Evidence and exact scope](BACKEND_CONNECTION_RECOVERY.md), [verification](test-evidence/2026-10-07-backend-recovery/verification.json). Current teammate code initially failed compilation due to `FormGuide.fieldName` referencing an undefined `node`; corrected to its `field` parameter. No tests skipped. No live model calls, public HTTPS test, physical phone, signed release or deployment. The user's physical-phone configuration had no USB/hosted endpoint; standalone phone cloud use awaits the agreed next deployment phase. Historical WebView/primary failure causes are not claimed solved by passing reruns.

## In-progress handoff — 5 October 2026, local-first and conditional cloud navigation

The user authorized this manual run down to **8% weekly remaining**. Current usage is **6%**, so stop implementation and resume after allowance is available or the user explicitly changes the limit. Do not consume reset credits. The scheduled automation still has its separate 25% rule.

Implemented, uncommitted: LiveGuide.plan and SaathiSession now use an exact local match before cloud guidance, with private/ambiguous handover. Backend live navigation tries the configured primary (SAATHI_PRIMARY_PROVIDER, default gemini) then one secondary only for provider failure, uncertain/invalid output or explicit HANDOVER. Both share the original deadline and budgets; quota/cancellation/staleness do not trigger fallback. Incident assessment and explicit provider checks still use paired validation. Navigation responses declare decision_policy and actual single-provider provenance; Android strictly decodes this or the legacy paired contract. Consent copy reflects local/primary/fallback use; styles and colors are unchanged. The legacy mode name dual_ai now means two adapters available, not two calls per live navigation request.

Evidence: **80 Android unit tests pass**; debug/test builds passed before the final consent-copy edits. **89 offline backend tests passed**, including ten primary-navigation tests and localhost HTTP tests (prior tool output; the /tmp log disappeared, so no durable backend log is available). Four focused emulator tests produced **3 passes / 1 failure**: zero-HTTP exact local match and two decoder tests passed; primaryProtocolGuidesAnExternalDetourAndReturn failed at the first Help instruction with generic cannot-verify text. XML reports are preserved under test-evidence/2026-10-05-local-first-primary. Do not mark H2 integration or the whole release complete.

Failure investigation: a separate synthetic host request returned the expected primary-policy envelope; fixture status reported one Gemini attempt and zero Groq attempts, attributable to that host diagnostic. Thus the failed device flow had no confirmed provider dispatch. Next inspect safe request/rejection counters and snapshot eligibility; distinguish snapshot-null, Android validation, HTTP rejection and observation churn. Clock skew is a hypothesis only, never verified. Decoder tests passed, so do not loosen parsing or freshness to mask the failure. This failure is distinct from the earlier unresolved WebView post-tap issue. The emulator and fixture are no longer running on 5 October; temporary logs/tokens are gone. Recreate only synthetic test infrastructure and restart the fixture after any backend changes.

Next: reproduce/fix the failed integration, then run release build/lint and relevant emulator regressions against the final copy/config changes. H3 time/token/device/IP quotas, localization, voice/Sarvam, Cloud Run persistent state/enrollment, signing, real-model quality and physical-device acceptance remain open. No live model calls, hosting, signing, commit or push occurred. Preserve all pre-existing changes. Current audit remains docs/PROJECT_AUDIT.md and latest human spec is specs/PRODUCTION_RELEASE_BRIEF.md.

# Test results

## 4 October 2026 — account issuance failure recovery

**16 targeted offline tests pass**: eight new account-command tests and eight existing hosted-boundary tests. Before the fix, injected token-write failure reproduced loss of the old credential; the save-order and missing-sync tests also failed, and a SQLite error escaped unsanitized. The CLI now saves and syncs the token file/directory before rotating the database.

Coverage includes write/file-sync/directory-sync failure preserving previous access, database opening/issuance errors, retaining a usable candidate after a simulated post-commit error, exclusive file/symlink refusal, owner-only output, saved-before-rotation ordering, and no token in command output. Existing hosted isolation/quota/revocation checks still pass. See [targeted test log](test-evidence/2026-10-04-account-rotation/backend-tests.txt).

No live account/key, model call, external service or Android change. These are temporary SQLite/filesystem tests, not a host power-loss test. Prior full-suite/build/emulator evidence below was not rerun in this bounded phase.

## 4 October 2026 — hosted pilot and shared Android connection

**71 backend tests pass**, including eight hosted-token/isolation/budget tests. A real Gunicorn 26.2.0 subprocess passed six localhost checks with keys removed: readiness, HTTPS-scheme requirement, auth refusal, authenticated status, missing-provider refusal without calls, and revocation. See [backend log](test-evidence/2026-10-04-hosted-connection/backend-tests.txt) and [Gunicorn smoke](test-evidence/2026-10-04-hosted-connection/gunicorn-smoke.json).

Android: **77 unit tests**, debug/release/test APK builds and lint pass (0 errors/58 warnings). [Five emulator checks](test-evidence/2026-10-04-hosted-connection/emulator-connection.txt) pass: setup consent, real mock-HTTP practice/private handover, strict decoding, wrong-token/cancelled callbacks, and suppressing old results after disable/reconfigure. A temporary synthetic server and ephemeral token were used; no model requests. Existing palette/navigation/logo/glass geometry remain unchanged; release now exposes the existing connection screen and only accepts a build-selected HTTPS origin. No release signing or remote host is configured.

Untested: Caddy/systemd deployment, real TLS/remote Android release connection, public load/abuse and host recovery, live AI accuracy, browser paste, the original intermittent WebView cause, voice/physical-device behavior and remaining localization/design parity. The local Gunicorn check simulates a trusted proxy header; it is not a TLS test. See DEPLOYMENT.md for the exact operating limits.

## 4 October 2026 — provider deadlines and screen freshness

**63 offline backend tests pass**, including eight new latency/cancellation regressions. [Complete output](test-evidence/2026-10-04-provider-deadlines/backend-tests.txt) and [verification summary](test-evidence/2026-10-04-provider-deadlines/verification.json) are saved. The initial restricted run passed its non-network checks but could not bind five localhost test servers; the permitted localhost run passed the full suite. All model transports were synthetic; no keys were loaded and no live provider call occurred.

Verified: both adapters receive the remaining shared decision time (at most eight seconds); expired requests never dispatch; aged screens stop waiting at their remaining freshness deadline; cooperative workers release all four slots; expiry during budget reservation spends no provider calls; late body/EOF and late validation cannot release accepted guidance. Parsed replies arriving too late or after cancellation retain available token metadata without being marked successful. Screen-expiry cancellation does not by itself count as a provider-health failure.

Only backend runtime/tests and documentation changed. Android builds, emulator/browser/voice tests and live model checks were not repeated. Existing Android evidence remains historical. The final 3 October Groq record shows an 8,101ms timeout without a parsed HTTP reply; it cannot distinguish network/TLS delay from provider processing. This phase fixes local deadline propagation, **not** the unproven cause of that live timeout. Python blocking network operations may still outlive cooperative cancellation; worker admission remains bounded and late results are rejected. Live paired accuracy, incident quality, the original WebView failure, production connectivity and physical-device acceptance remain open.

## Latest live-provider check — 3 October 2026

Both providers returned valid responses on separate checks. The final pair had a valid Gemini response and a Groq timeout; the app returned diagnostic information and withheld guidance. The explicitly opted-in instrumentation check completed, and the offline backend suite passed **55 tests** after the Gemini parser fix. See [provider verification](PROVIDER_VERIFICATION.md) for the full sequence and saved evidence. The previous **75 Android unit / 12 focused emulator** results below remain the baseline for that phase.

## 3 October 2026 — API diagnostics and reviewed complaint workflow (latest)

**Final source:** 75 Android unit tests, 54 backend tests and 12 focused emulator tests pass. Debug, Android-test and release APK builds pass; lint has **0 errors / 61 warnings**. Final logs and machine-readable [verification](screenshots/2026-10-03-connection-drafts/verification.json) are saved in `screenshots/2026-10-03-connection-drafts/`.

- Backend coverage adds no-call status/mock checks, auth/consent enforcement, independent partial success, sanitized errors/usage, explicit test-vs-live provenance, missing configuration, cancellation, quota, timeout and both-provider circuit accounting. Initial sandbox-only attempt could not bind local test sockets; the authorized local-socket run passed. No live provider was called.
- Final emulator suite: ConnectionScreenUiTest (1), ConnectionCheckTest (2), GatewaySetupUiTest (1), ComplaintDraftUiTest (2), CyberLinkOverlayTest (2), CyberReportUiTest (4). The Check APIs button traverses actual Android HTTP through adb reverse and the authenticated server to two **injected synthetic REST responses**, not Gemini/Groq. Wrong bearer token, strict metadata, denied copy, exact field content, review invalidation, privacy clearing and permission loss were exercised. Each run cleans the temporary token and reverse mapping.
- Unit tests add unknown-fact omission, exact supplied figures/uncertainty, blank-account rejection and section order. No assertion claims factual correctness beyond the supplied account.
- Initial 11-test and follow-up 3-test runs passed. Screenshot inspection then found default-purple selected chips; shared secondary/tertiary containers were bound to the existing Saathi greens, followed by the final 12-test run. `final-evidence/` supersedes earlier screenshots. Production screens/overlays keep FLAG_SECURE; tests only lift it for synthetic in-app screenshots. The protected floating overlay screenshot is intentionally not visual evidence of readable content.

**Blocked/untested:** live keys were removed; provider-account calls/dashboard usage and genuine AI accuracy remain unverified. No authenticated cybercrime form, automatic paste, complaint submission or real incident was tested. New TTS instructions compile but audible output was not exercised. Physical devices/OEM survival, streaming conversation, production release connectivity and the original intermittent WebView post-tap cause remain open. Prior service/browser results below are historical evidence, not rerun claims for this phase.

## 3 October 2026 — backend recovery, incident assessment and portal follow-up

**Final source:** 71 Android unit tests and 46 Python backend tests pass. Debug APK/test APK build and lint pass (0 errors, 61 warnings). Eleven distinct emulator tests pass in two final direct instrumentation suites: `GatewayIntegrationTest` + `CyberReportUiTest` (7, mock backend), then `IncidentAssessmentUiTest` + `LiveAiIntegrationTest` + `LiveAccessibilityIntegrationTest` (4, independent deterministic protocol fixtures). Each suite used a fresh loopback server/shared ephemeral token; test credentials and reverse mapping were removed afterward. The earlier 8-test mixed run and post-event-fix 4-test Gradle run also passed. Final direct logs and [verification](screenshots/2026-10-03-backend-reporting/verification.json) are retained.

New backend tests cover corrupt/locked budget storage, failed first/second worker submission, pre-admission cancellation, cancellation without poisoning provider health, expired reservation deadlines, sanitized auth/rate/timeout failures, malformed envelopes, escaped surrogates, HTTP recovery, incident consent/privacy, paired agreement and rejection of invented legal certainty. Model transport tests use synthetic envelopes, not real provider calls.

Android checks exercise per-use Share once, Keep private without transmission, private-summary refusal, unavailable-backend offline advice, accepted paired fixture result, clearing/recreation, three-language recovery helpers, actual HTTP authentication and cancelled callbacks, service detour/return and WebView mutation. Screenshots of the synthetic consent dialog and light/dark reporting screens were reviewed. Reporting dialogs explicitly use Saathi's surface color, avoiding Material's default purple tint; buttons retain shared content-sized padding. Production screens remain screenshot-protected.

Portal: `https://cybercrime.gov.in/` returned HTTP200 with certificate verification, and emulator Chrome showed a secure connection. `https://www.cybercrime.gov.in/` failed curl certificate validation (expired-certificate error); web retrieval also failed for www. This is an observed environment result, not a claim of universal availability. Chrome traversal: mobile menu → Register a Complaint → FINANCIAL FRAUD → category page → financial Register a Complaint → public filing explanation (`Accept.aspx`). No legal declaration, private entry, OTP, report or tracking lookup was submitted. Public screenshots are saved as portal-menu/categories/handover.png.

**Failures retained:** A repetition before the overlay fix failed the idle-stability assertion (revision 11→13); this is separate from the original post-tap issue. Four later diagnostic repetitions passed. Trace showed a known Saathi overlay window's WINDOW_STATE event classified as own while its WINDOWS_CHANGED event was not; the old package-name requirement caused this gap. Filtering now uses only current attached window ownership. Final traces correctly classify own WINDOWS_CHANGED events and the service test passes. These results do not prove the cause of the original post-tap failure or guarantee no recurrence. Failure artifacts pulled from the first repetition directory include preceding successful-run files; only `webview-repeat-2.txt` is the authoritative failing assertion. Later reproduction directories were cleared before each run.

One standalone attempt could not launch after Gradle uninstalled the test APK; reinstall resolved it. After an approval-review usage interruption, the emulator needed cold boot/unlock; an instrumentation harness stalled before external storage was available and was terminated, then final bounded direct runs passed. These setup failures were not counted as passing tests. Approval review resumed after usage reset; no reset credits were consumed.

Still unverified: real Gemini/Groq responses and classification quality, private portal workflow/submission, original WebView post-tap cause, actual microphone transcripts/voice quality, physical-device/OEM survival, production HTTPS/user auth/release connectivity. Full historical UI/performance suites were not rerun. No paid service, publishing, merge or push occurred.

# Test results — 29 September 2026

## Latest: live request changes and shared assistant theme — 1 October 2026

Final check: **52 unit tests + 5 focused emulator tests passed**, zero failures/errors/skips. Debug build passed; lint passed with **0 errors / 61 warnings**. Command: `JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-17.jdk/Contents/Home ./gradlew testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug lintDebug connectedDebugAndroidTest -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.class=com.saathi.ui.LiveAccessibilityIntegrationTest,com.saathi.ui.PermissionLossIntegrationTest,com.saathi.ui.AssistantUiTest,com.saathi.ui.VoiceLifecycleTest`.

- New parser checks cover explicit English/Hindi/Hinglish option requests, ordinary conversational replies and controls, forbidden/secret/oversized input.
- The real enabled service switches the requested target from native Help to WebView Support without an external event or session restart, then back. Immediate old-bound clearing, stale screen/session rejection, refused labels and post-Stop rejection pass. Existing event-driven detour/return, target disappearance and Stop also pass. This invokes the request handoff directly, **not through a real microphone**.
- Live overlay/accessibility revocation and no automatic restart after restoration still pass. Voice foreground waiting/background and obsolete notification actions still pass; no audio was exercised.
- Assistant text/voice mode selection remains functional and starts no microphone by itself. Light/dark captures were visually inspected: shared S mark/header, existing green/mint palette, readable text, rounded input, glass fallback actions and themed mode chips. The sampled portrait captures do not establish all-screen, large-font, TalkBack or tablet parity. The live overlay's existing NEXT STEP label still overlaps a nearby fixture heading; not redesigned in this core phase.
- Evidence: [verification](screenshots/2026-10-01-live-requests/verification.json), [light](screenshots/2026-10-01-live-requests/assistant-light.png), [dark](screenshots/2026-10-01-live-requests/assistant-dark.png), [retarget](screenshots/2026-10-01-live-requests/live-service-retarget.png). New code and earlier edits remain local/uncommitted; no push or provider enablement occurred.

Still incomplete: connected reasoning backend, arbitrary multi-step guidance, natural streaming/barge-in, actual speech-to-request delivery, real Chrome/Firefox page compatibility, physical-device microphone/TTS/OEM survival, and the broader release/design matrix. Chrome first-run setup is still pending. The emulator was closed after verification without saving a snapshot. Older entries below retain historical counts and limitations; this entry is the current scoped result.


Host: macOS arm64, Zulu JDK17.0.20.1, Gradle8.7, AGP8.6.1, Kotlin2.0.21. Android min26/compile35/target33. Compose BOM2024.10.01. Emulator: Pixel_9_Pro, Android17/API37.2, arm64 16KB page system image; no physical device.

## Passing

`JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-17.jdk/Contents/Home ./gradlew testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug lintDebug connectedDebugAndroidTest`

- 20 unit tests, zero failures: guardrails, policy, demo progression, observation identity, multilingual filtering, task routing.
- Debug APK builds at app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk.
- Lint: zero errors, 57 warnings. Not a warning-free build.
- Four emulator UI tests: typed task→permission setup and disabled action; light/dark Home rendering; Hindi 200% scrolling and task intake; onboarding language and confirmed local-data reset.
- Final screenshot-export/theme-interaction rerun: all four tests passed, zero failures/errors, BUILD SUCCESSFUL. Light, dark and Hindi captures were visually reviewed.
- Screenshots: docs/screenshots/2026-09-29. Captures are Compose content, excluding Android system bars. Screenshots validate sampled views, not all-screen parity.
- Phase-one final unit count was 18 passing (28 September); earlier baseline was seven passing with seven lint errors/59 warnings.

The first emulator run failed before interactions because older Espresso reflected a removed InputManager method. Test dependencies updated to runner1.7.0, junit1.3.0, Espresso3.7.0, following [official AndroidX Test release notes](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/test). Tests then passed. Screenshot export was changed to additionalTestOutputDir because the runner uninstalls test APKs afterward. Visual inspection found a light image mislabeled dark; the test now switches through Settings and checks both saved preference and rendered background before capturing.

## Not verified / not implemented

- Real-device TalkBack, cross-app touch passthrough, notification Stop, service/overlay races, microphone/TTS release, lock/unlock, permission revocation, process death, landscape/narrow displays, battery and latency: not verified. The selected synthetic goal uses saved state but recreation behavior has not yet been instrumented.
- Hindi large-text home is readable and the primary action is reachable; native translation review, Hinglish screenshots, and every screen at large fonts remain pending.
- No actual speech recognizer/TTS engine interaction was tested. Engines may use network services.
- Cloud/backend, dual-provider validation, authentication and quotas are not implemented; provider and capture paths remain disabled. No real-app or payment success claim.
- Figma components and Home in both themes visually inspected; other frames, exact local-source fidelity, fonts and animation timing remain unverified. See DESIGN_SYSTEM.md for known parity gaps.
- Source credential path removed; exhaustive APK binary/secret scanning not performed.

Use only made-up values for remaining synthetic practice tests. Record actual device/OS/build and observed outcomes before extending compatibility claims.


## Navigation phase — final verification

Full build/unit/lint plus nine functional UI tests passed after fixing dock occlusion and dark heading inheritance. Adding the frame-metrics test produced a final connected run with **10 tests, zero failures/errors, BUILD SUCCESSFUL**. The subsequent isolated metrics run passed its one test; it overwrites the generated connected XML. No production code changed after the full passing functional run.

New checks: nested route selection/Back; intermediate spring position; rapid-tap retarget; continuous category indicator during an unfinished drag; category restoration on leaving/returning; persisted opaque mode across activity recreation; immediate reduced-motion selection; reachable Hindi category/action at320dp and200% font scale. Original task routing/theme/privacy checks remain. Unit tests remain20 passing; lint0errors/57warnings. `git diff --check` passed.

Reviewed screenshots: light Home, dark Practice, Hindi200% narrow Practice/action and both Figma navigation sets plus integrated light/dark Home. Captures now include full Compose root with edge-to-edge insets. New images are in screenshots/2026-09-29-navigation. The earlier screenshots are historical and retained.

**Performance not passed:** Android Window FrameMetrics TOTAL_DURATION on the software-rendered emulator measured p50=138.52ms/p95=253.50ms with recording (165frames); p50=157.92ms/p95=299.70ms without recording (226frames). All frames exceeded16.67ms. This is a measured limitation, not evidence of smooth60Hz animation. See MOTION_AND_HAPTICS.md for profiling follow-up and exact JSON files.

Not run: physical-device frame profiling, TalkBack traversal, API26–30 fallback, low-RAM/power-save/high-contrast toggles, landscape, Hinglish-specific screenshots, full frame-by-frame video review, system-scale-zero pager release, and per-pixel blur validation. Reduced-transparency preference and relevant selection semantics were verified on the emulator; that does not substitute for TalkBack testing.

## Latest safety and Liquid Glass phase

21 unit tests, zero failures/errors/skips; debug APK builds; lint zero errors/57 warnings. Added stale-presentation matching test for permission-related stop so an obsolete overlay cannot terminate a newer observation/session. AppOps watching, startup permission check, expected overlay attachment exception handling and animator cleanup compile successfully. **Live permission revocation/attachment failure is not instrumented or device-verified.** Implementation uses the platform [AppOpsManager watcher](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AppOpsManager).

11 emulator UI tests passed in the full final regression run. Added glass action/disabled-state semantics, opaque fallback on Home, task input, and privacy cancellation coverage. Initial new-test failure was in screenshot capture: the dialog adds a second root; fixed by explicitly targeting the dialog window. Tests and screenshots now distinguish that window. All earlier navigation, Hindi200%, narrow320dp, settings/recreation and privacy-reset checks pass.

Current visual evidence: screenshots/2026-09-29-glass. Reviewed light/dark Home, large Hindi text, dark intake, disabled setup action, and privacy dialog. The native practice button style compiles but its rendered appearance and native form interaction were not exercised during this phase. Pointer hover, keyboard traversal, full TalkBack and all device-fallback branches remain unverified.

Latest broad software-emulator frame sample:160frames, p50=154.34ms, p95=206.94ms; 160 exceed16.67ms. **Performance remains unaccepted.** This debug measurement includes screen composition/test work; it is not a device smoothness certification or a controlled comparison against the previous phase. No physical-device profiling and no new motion video were captured.

See GLASS_UI.md for the audited controls left in historical/native surfaces and Figma synchronization still pending. No full-specification or every-control parity claim.

Final dialog brand-color correction was followed by another complete successful11-test emulator run plus unit/build/lint checks. Exported screenshots and metrics reflect that run.

## Vector identity, launch transition and notification Stop follow-up

Final optimized-vector run:22 unit tests and13 emulator UI tests pass with zero failures/errors. Debug build succeeds; lint reports zero errors/60 warnings. Added launcher entry/recreation/background-return checks and installed adaptive-icon verification/export. Added unit regression proving notification session identity survives observation changes and becomes invalid after stop/restart. Actual queued notification delivery race remains untested.

New SVG and Android vector geometry was rendered and inspected in both standalone and installed adaptive-icon form. Initial detailed contours produced long-path warnings; simplified fitted curves reduced the mark to25 cubic segments and removed those warnings. Old raster assets are intentionally preserved. Remaining new lint findings include the preserved unused raster, a name-based CustomSplashScreen warning for LaunchActivity (which uses AndroidX SplashScreen, not a dedicated custom splash page), and a missing-monochrome warning on the API26 icon variant (the API33 variant contains monochrome). No warning-free claim.

Cold-launch recording and sampled frames: screenshots/2026-09-29-launch/saathi-launch.mp4 and launch-*.png. Reviewed centered mint logo, easing and fade into real content. This is a software-emulator recording, not proof of physical-device60Hz performance. Android26–30, Android12, reduced-motion settings, OEM masks/themed icon appearance and genuinely slow initialization remain unverified. Earlier glass/performance limitations continue to apply.

The original startup lint run flagged an API27 navigation-bar attribute in a min26 style; the unnecessary attribute was removed before the passing run. All changes remain local/uncommitted.

## Local-practice state safety follow-up

`testDebugUnitTest`, `assembleDebug` and `lintDebug` pass after the local-practice state pass. The unit suite now has **25 tests**, zero failures/errors: the added policy cases cover every registered synthetic Bill Pay control, reject a matching control ID in another package, and reject unregistered Saathi screens. The new debug APK builds successfully. Lint reports zero errors and 61 warnings; it is not warning-free.

This run did **not** start an emulator. The UI state mapping, empty-window callback, notification transition, overlay removal, actual TTS-engine callback timing, screen lock, permission revocation, TalkBack and physical-device behavior remain untested. The tests prove policy and compilation only; they do not prove an external app can never resemble the fixture or that Android will deliver every lifecycle callback on a particular device.

## Zero-spend proposal-validation foundation

The subsequent `testDebugUnitTest` run passes with **32 unit tests**, zero failures/errors. Seven new pure tests cover agreeing proposals, disagreement, stale screen metadata, invalid targets, timeout/quota/malformed results, safe handover and an identifier-only snapshot. No provider/network/emulator test was run because this contract is intentionally not connected to the app. A transport-free test contract does not verify a future backend, model, provider, data-retention policy, quota system or real AI output.

## Speech-setting safety follow-up

After adding persisted speech-rate choices, local preview wiring and dormant microphone-service guards, `testDebugUnitTest`, `assembleDebug` and `lintDebug` again pass with **32 unit tests**, zero failures/errors. No emulator or physical device was available. The result does not verify TTS initialization timing, installed language packs, preview output, rate audibility, microphone permission prompts, cancellation, phone-call/headset behavior, audio focus or the legacy service's broadcast consumer flow.

## Background voice and wrong-path recovery — 30 September 2026

Final combined `testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug lintDebug connectedDebugAndroidTest` run: **BUILD SUCCESSFUL**, **41 unit tests and 18 emulator tests**, zero failures/errors/skips. Lint: **0 errors, 57 warnings**. `git diff --check` passes. Environment: Pixel_9_Pro AVD, Android 17/API37, arm64, software graphics, headless/no audio. No physical device or cloud provider was used.

New unit coverage: utterance/recognition cancellation identities; English/Hindi/Hinglish voice command parsing; unknown phrases; wrong-category and wrong-success recovery; missing recovery target; returning to the original category; partial trees. New instrumented coverage reads the real fixture accessibility tree, verifies the actual Back to choices route, handles an unrelated tile, and proves activity recreation retains the bill type but clears account/PIN values. Speech speed persists and preview remains available without starting conversation.

The emulator reports `onDeviceRecognizerAvailable=true`. The real microphone foreground service was tested **in waiting mode with no audio turn**: it remains active after the activity backgrounds, stops, restarts, and ignores the previous session's Stop notification. Final session Stop removes the service. This is not proof of speech quality, permission-dialog behavior, audio capture/release, or continuous microphone operation. Recognition/TTS callbacks are unit-gated; actual engine race behavior still needs device testing. Recovery tests call the guide with a real tree, not the full live accessibility-service/overlay/audio pipeline.

Evidence: [verification summary](screenshots/2026-09-30-voice/verification.json), [recognizer capability](screenshots/2026-09-30-voice/voice-capability.txt), and [speech settings screenshot](screenshots/2026-09-30-voice/voice-settings.png). The screenshot was visually inspected: speed choices, selected Slow state, preview and floating navigation are readable. No new overlay-motion video or full session-screen visual review was captured.

An earlier emulator run encountered a **System UI ANR** whose window stole Espresso focus; it was interrupted and the emulator cold-started. A clean 17-test run then passed; after final source changes and the service test, the full 18-test run above passed. No test was skipped or disabled to get the result.

Performance remains **unaccepted**: the broad software-emulator frame sample recorded169 frames, p50=278.42ms and p95=456.26ms, all above16.67ms. This includes composition and test synchronization, is not a controlled comparison, and does not establish physical-device smoothness. Raw metrics are saved beside the screenshot.

Not implemented: natural open-ended AI conversation, streaming speech/barge-in, protected backend or real-app guidance. Not tested: actual audio, native language quality, calls/Bluetooth/headphones, battery, permission revocation, lock/process-death integration, live overlay correction end-to-end, or older Android fallback. Continue with VOICE_CONVERSATION.md and EXECUTION_PLAN.md; no all-bugs-fixed or full-specification-complete claim.

## Local mock gateway — 30 September continuation

`python3 -m unittest discover -s backend/tests -v`: **19 tests pass**, zero failures/errors/skips, Python3.14 on macOS. This includes four real localhost HTTP tests for authentication, JSON/body restrictions, cancellation authorization and startup token validation; the remaining tests cover concurrent isolated mock calls, disagreement, malformed/stale/private targets, uncertain responses, completion evidence, timeouts, cancellation, newer-screen invalidation, expiry during work, quota reservation, circuit breaking and worker/session bounds. The first sandboxed run passed13 core cases but could not bind localhost (PermissionError); rerunning with approved local-network permission passed17, and the final expanded suite passed19. No failing case was removed or skipped.

No provider calls, credentials, paid service, audio or emulator were involved. Android source was unchanged in this phase, so the earlier41-unit/18-emulator evidence was preserved rather than rerun. `git diff --check` passes. No deployed-backend, durable-quota, real-model independence, native-language-output, Android transport or natural-conversation claim. Mock completion requires a matching synthetic success/category marker; a future app must still verify that the live observation matches before showing it.


## Floating assistant and experimental cross-app guidance — 30 September 2026

Added Home’s **Help in apps & browsers**, a separate typed/dictated intake panel, explicit Text only / Text + voice selection, a draggable branded bubble, notification return, and a local exact-visible-option resolver. The production app never performs taps. Unclear/duplicate targets and detected private screens do not get a guessed target. The resolver handles labelled clickable parents and links without resource IDs; only identical nonempty tap rectangles are deduplicated. Tree-reading limits, remote-node failure handling, obsolete foreground-service shutdown protection, wrapped overlay text and Android cross-app touch opacity were hardened.

The cross-app tests read actual accessibility trees but supply observations manually: the native fixture and Settings pass through the session coordinator; the local WebView exercises the resolver and real overlay service directly. Tests inject taps to verify the underlying controls still work and tap the actual bubble to reopen the panel. This is **not** a test of the enabled Saathi AccessibilityService event pipeline or arbitrary browser compatibility. Text-mode tests cover selection and absence of automatic session/microphone startup; cancellation during an actual spoken utterance remains untested.

**Observed compatibility limit:** Settings force-hides the windows (`mIsForceHiddenNonSystemOverlayWindow=true`, `isOnScreen=false`). Its target still resolves, but the screenshot has no marker/bubble. A separately installed synthetic test APK, with native Help and a local WebView Support link, permits visible overlays and touch-through. No real account, payment, remote page, provider or captured audio was involved.

Earlier runs exposed test defects: forcing a background activity to RESUMED did not bring its task forward; launching non-exported MainActivity from the shell was rejected; and a non-null Kotlin parameter added a runtime check unavailable in the standalone test APK. Tests now use Home plus the appropriate launcher/app-owned return intent and a nullable fixture callback. The separate fixture closes explicitly between checks. The targeted cross-app/voice rerun passed all three checks before the final complete regression run. No failing test was disabled.

Visual review: marker, cursor, floating brand button and wrapped status are visible in the separate-app fixtures. The NEXT STEP badge can overlap surrounding page headings, although the target itself is legible; collision-aware placement remains open. These are static screenshots, not motion or performance acceptance.

Still incomplete: arbitrary multi-step AI, natural streaming/barge-in conversation, Android/backend integration, full panel localization/Figma parity, real AccessibilityService integration, Chrome/Firefox fixtures and real-device background/audio/permission/battery behavior. Existing physical-device performance and older-Android acceptance gaps remain.

Final complete regression before the small panel polish: **49 unit tests and 22 emulator tests pass**, zero failures/errors/skips; debug APK builds; lint **0 errors / 61 warnings**. Evidence: [verification summary](screenshots/2026-09-30-assistant/verification.json), [intake](screenshots/2026-09-30-assistant/assistant-intake.png), [native external fixture](screenshots/2026-09-30-assistant/external-help.png), [local web fixture](screenshots/2026-09-30-assistant/external-support.png), and [Settings overlay restriction](screenshots/2026-09-30-assistant/live-settings.png). The waiting-mode voice service still survives Home, ignores an obsolete Stop action after restart, and shuts down explicitly. No microphone audio or speech quality was tested.

The broad regression frame sample remains **unaccepted**: 173 frames, p50 284.31ms / p95 425.96ms, all above 16.67ms on the software-rendered emulator. This is not a controlled comparison or physical-device performance claim. Screenshot review found a clipped input outline and default purple mode selection; a subsequent panel-only correction adds inner spacing/rounded input geometry and the existing green palette. Terminal session states also no longer display an active-status sentence.

After that panel correction, all **49 unit tests plus both assistant-panel instrumented tests pass**, and build/lint pass again. The exported intake image was refreshed and visually reviewed; the complete 22-test run above preceded this isolated panel change. The latest generated connected XML therefore contains two tests; the saved verification JSON preserves both runs. Changes remain local/uncommitted; no push, paid service, provider call or publish occurred.


## Real AccessibilityService event pipeline — 1 October 2026

Final focused command (listed in the [verification JSON](screenshots/2026-10-01-live-service/verification.json)): **49 unit tests and 4 instrumented tests pass**, zero failures/errors/skips. Debug APK builds; lint **0 errors / 61 warnings**. This focused run includes the new real-service flow, both earlier cross-app component checks and the waiting-mode voice lifecycle check. The full UI suite was not rerun; its prior 22-test evidence remains historical. Backend code was unchanged and its earlier 19-test result was not rerun.

The new test uses Android’s [non-suppressing UiAutomation flag](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/UiAutomation#FLAG_DONT_SUPPRESS_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICES), enables the actual Saathi AccessibilityService on the emulator and restores the prior service/AppOps settings afterward. It does not call the guide or presenter, supply observations, or manually invalidate the screen. A separate test APK exposes native Help/Explore/Back controls and a local WebView Support link. Real OS events produce initial guidance, a no-target detour correction, return guidance, changed-label invalidation, clearing on the Saathi app, WebView guidance/mutation, and explicit Stop. An idle observation remains stable after initial WebView loading settles.

Reviewed screenshots: [native target](screenshots/2026-10-01-live-service/live-service-native.png), [detour correction](screenshots/2026-10-01-live-service/live-service-detour.png), and [web target](screenshots/2026-10-01-live-service/live-service-web.png). The detour removes the target marker and shows the existing back/clarification text; it does not resolve or highlight a new Back control. The known NEXT STEP badge overlap with nearby headings remains open. The established Saathi colors, logo, bubble and overlay styling were preserved; no new design source or product UI was added. Static evidence only; no new timing/performance acceptance claim.

Early test failures were diagnosed rather than skipped: UiAutomation command arguments retained quote characters around the component; bound-service dumps list a service label instead of the expected class; first WebView initialization can still emit legitimate layout events after the first native target; and link labels can live under a clickable parent. Test setup/assertions now reflect those observed platform facts. The production service’s manifest is aligned with [Android’s documented declaration](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/service): exported with the system-only BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE permission retained. The tests do not establish that the old exported value caused the setup failures. No other production behavior changed in this phase.

**Remaining:** real Chrome/Firefox coverage, overlay-hidden screens, notification/permission revocation/lock integration, actual microphone/TTS turns, prolonged OEM background behavior, older Android and physical-device latency/battery. Natural multistep reasoning and streaming voice remain unimplemented. This controlled fixture closes one integration gap; it does not certify all apps/browsers or crash-free operation. No real page/account, provider, paid service, audio input or transaction was used. Work remains local and uncommitted.


## Live permission loss — 1 October 2026, next bounded run

Final focused command in [verification.json](screenshots/2026-10-01-permissions/verification.json): **49 unit tests and 2 instrumented tests pass**, zero failures/errors/skips. Debug build succeeds; lint **0 errors / 61 warnings**. This run combines the existing real-service native/WebView flow with the new permission-loss flow. The first standalone permission test also passed; its cleanup was then made robust to a previously enabled Saathi service before the final two-test run. No tests were skipped. Full UI, backend and performance suites were not rerun because production code/design was unchanged.

The new emulator-only test starts real text-only guidance in the external synthetic app, revokes overlay access using AppOps, and verifies the active session, presentation identity and guidance window clear. Restoring overlay access does not resume observation. After an explicit foreground restart, the test revokes Saathi’s AccessibilityService, verifies session/window shutdown, then re-enables the service and verifies no automatic session restart. It restores the original enabled-service list and overlay AppOps. It does not manually inject observations or call Stop to cause those assertions. The observation checks confirm the combined runtime behavior, not one particular callback being the sole cause.

Evidence: [permission result](screenshots/2026-10-01-permissions/permission-loss-result.txt). No new screenshot is needed for a non-visual permission transition. Existing UI, colors, logo, glass and navigation were preserved. No production code changed in this run.

**Browser readiness blocker:** the emulator’s installed Chrome opens its first-run screen with a Terms of Service/usage-data notice, an Add account option and Stay signed out. No consent was submitted and no account was added. Real Chrome page compatibility remains untested pending browser setup; the previous WebView evidence must not be relabelled as Chrome coverage. [Readiness record](screenshots/2026-10-01-permissions/browser-readiness.txt). The next continuation can work on lock/notification tests or Android/mock gateway contracts while browser setup remains pending.

Still unverified: permission revocation during actual microphone capture/TTS, Android/OEM differences, lock/process-death integration, prolonged background operation and physical-device battery/performance. No natural AI, streaming conversation, universal browser or crash-free claim. Changes remain local/uncommitted; no publishing, paid services or provider calls.


## Travel privacy, cyber-fraud reporting and backend admission — 2 October 2026

Final focused build: **66 Android unit tests, 33 backend tests and 12 emulator checks passed**, zero failures/errors/skips. Debug APK builds; Android lint **0 errors / 60 warnings**. The emulator run covers the four reporting-screen checks, copy-overlay consent/revocation, a real accessibility-tree travel/OTP fixture, two assistant checks, the actual AccessibilityService flow and three shared-UI/large-Hindi-text checks. It is not the entire historical UI suite. Backend tests include actual localhost HTTP and synthetic provider payloads, without paid/external provider calls.

[Verification summary](screenshots/2026-10-02-cyber-privacy/verification.json), [focused test XML](screenshots/2026-10-02-cyber-privacy/focused-tests.xml), [light reporting screen](screenshots/2026-10-02-cyber-privacy/cyber-light.png), [dark reporting screen](screenshots/2026-10-02-cyber-privacy/cyber-dark.png), [floating copy consent](screenshots/2026-10-02-cyber-privacy/cyber-floating-consent.png).

The native fixture exposes From/To, 01/10/2026, ₹5221, ₹6,398, a time and Shopping. Real Android trees retain those labels and resolve noneditable targets; adding an OTP input masks its value and removes the guidance target. This does not reproduce the current IRCTC/Google Flights browser DOM or the user's phone. Regression units cover sensitive metadata priority, date-of-birth/account-number labels, adjacent secrets and URL-contained numbers. Both Android and backend live-label rules are exercised.

The reporting checks verify text default/no running session, explicit approve versus decline before changing the clipboard, content-sized short buttons, draft clearing on recreation with checklist position retained, bounded Back/Next, light/dark appearance and denied-overlay fallback. The overlay check uses a separate synthetic app: refusal leaves the test clipboard intact, approval copies only the fixed portal URL, and permission revocation removes the helper. Screenshot protection was disabled only in the test on the empty synthetic reporting screen to capture theme evidence; production keeps it enabled. No personal incident or real transaction was entered. Actual microphone/TTS delivery, lock/timeout paths of this new helper, physical devices, very large-font overlay scrolling and browser/OEM differences remain unverified.

Issues encountered: the first new travel fixture used a Kotlin collections helper absent from the separately installed test APK; it now uses an array loop and passes. Visual review found dark text inheriting the wrong content color; shared theme content color was applied, rerun and reviewed. One earlier mixed run missed the existing WebView post-tap transition. Its assertion now first checks that the fixture link actually changed; the isolated run and final 12-test run passed. The cause of that intermittent failure is not conclusively established and should remain in device/regression follow-up. No failing test was skipped.

Backend fixes are specifically tested: public-display privacy exceptions, malformed provider target/explanation types, stale admission before model call reservation, expiry during work, and inactive-session eviction without resetting quotas. Existing cancellation/disagreement/quota/bounded-worker checks remain passing. This is not a guarantee that every backend edge case is fixed or that hosted authentication/TLS/release connectivity works.

Official portal page loads timed out or returned gateway errors; official indexed source extracts supported the reporting checklist. No live complaint walkthrough, CAPTCHA, OTP, upload, final submission or status confirmation was attempted. Incident triage is explicitly local/limited, not model-backed classification. No credentials, paid services, publishing or Git push. See [CYBER_FRAUD_REPORTING.md](CYBER_FRAUD_REPORTING.md) for sources and remaining scope.

Follow-up after the 12-case run: the overlay test was strengthened so **both refusal and approval happen while the separate app is foreground**. It passed on its own (1 test, zero failures/errors/skips); [result](screenshots/2026-10-02-cyber-privacy/external-copy-approval-tests.xml). Production code was unchanged. The original focused results remain saved rather than overwritten by this targeted rerun.


## Browser follow-up and whitespace bounds — 2 October 2026

**67 Android unit / 34 backend / 2 focused emulator tests pass**, zero failures/errors/skips. Debug APK builds; lint 0 errors / 61 warnings. [Verification](screenshots/2026-10-02-browser-followup/verification.json), [browser XML](screenshots/2026-10-02-browser-followup/browser-tests.xml), [Chrome travel screenshot](screenshots/2026-10-02-browser-followup/chrome-public-travel.png), [tap geometry](screenshots/2026-10-02-browser-followup/tap-geometry.txt).

Fixed an actual validation gap: length checks used trimmed length while forwarding untrimmed fields. Android live goals/labels/history and backend live fields/provider explanations now enforce actual string length plus nonblank content. Boundary/padded/whitespace-only regressions pass; no external model calls occurred. Established app UI and theme are unchanged.

Chrome now exercises public To, 01/10/2026, ₹5221 and ₹6,398 on a localhost synthetic page through the real AccessibilityService. It verifies no privacy flag, destination and date retargeting, removal on page departure, password-screen suspension, detour/return, link mutation and Stop. This is not a reproduction on IRCTC/Google Flights or a cybercrime complaint portal walkthrough. The screenshot still shows the previously known NEXT STEP badge overlapping a nearby heading; no overlay-placement fix is claimed.

The initial Chrome run hit first-run setup after emulator restoration, not the fixture. Setup was completed signed out, optional usage reporting switched off and notifications declined. One cold WebView run failed its initial idle assertion while the presentation revision changed during startup. The test now requires a bounded one-second settling interval before retaining the original separate one-second idle assertion; endless refresh still fails. The final paired Chrome/WebView run passed. The earlier post-tap mutation failure did not reproduce; geometry diagnostics now record tap areas, and failure diagnostics capture window/geometry state. That original intermittent cause is still not established and must not be described as a production fix. No assertion/test was skipped.

A direct retry of the official cybercrime portal again timed out. Live complaint navigation, real AI incident assessment, successful microphone input and production/provider/hardware acceptance remain open. Previous 12-test reporting/UI results are retained separately and were not rerun because those screens were unchanged in this continuation.
## 11 October 2026 — final pre-deployment checkpoint

- **PASS:** Full deterministic backend suite: 170 tests, including local HTTP and hosted boundaries, `Ran 170 tests in 7.686s`, `OK`. No provider calls.
- **PASS:** `:app:assembleDebug`, `:app:assembleRelease` and `:app:lint` completed successfully on the current tree.
- **PASS:** Samsung `SelectionFormTest` 2/2 and `PhysicalSpeechTest` 1/1. The speech result is bounded engine evidence only; no audio/transcript was retained.
- **INVALID HARNESS RUN:** A concurrent invocation of `VoiceLifecycleTest` overlapped with the other Samsung instrumentation processes and left many stale/dead accessibility bindings. Do not count its failure as a production defect or as a new acceptance result. The valid isolated result remains `VoiceLifecycleTest` 1/1 in 8.193 seconds. No complete device accessibility setting was cleared because that could disable unrelated user services.
- UI, branding, navigation, colors and glass controls were unchanged. No browser, commerce, portal, private form, payment or provider call was made.
- Handoff: `docs/HANDOFF_2026-10-11_FINAL_PREDEPLOYMENT.md`.
## 11 October 2026 — Fresh current-continuation regression

- Android `:app:testDebugUnitTest --rerun-tasks`: **168 passed, 0 failed, 0 errors, 0 skipped**.
- Backend `python3 -m unittest discover -s backend/tests -p 'test_*.py'`: **170 passed in 8.063s**. Local loopback permission was required; no external provider or network call was made.
- `:app:assembleDebug :app:assembleRelease :app:lint`: **BUILD SUCCESSFUL**; lint reports 0 errors and 60 warnings.
- Offline deployment preflight: **4 focused tests passed**. `deploy/preflight.py` checks future private configuration/state permissions and placeholder-free settings without starting a server, using a provider, or printing secrets.
- Samsung post-restore launch smoke: `LaunchActivity` opened successfully in 272 ms and the Saathi process was present. This is a basic install/launch check, not a continuous-background or human-voice acceptance result.
- Final tracked-source Gemini/Groq key-pattern scan: no matches. Ignored local credential files were not read.
- Samsung `VoiceLifecycleTest`: the test method is recorded **PASS 1/1** in the generated XML, while the Android instrumentation process reports a teardown crash and Gradle exits non-zero. No Saathi fatal exception was present in the filtered log. Keep this as a runner/device teardown blocker, not a clean physical-device suite pass.
- No UI, layout, navigation, brand, color or production guidance source changed in this checkpoint. No deployment, release signing, model call, account, portal or transaction was performed.
